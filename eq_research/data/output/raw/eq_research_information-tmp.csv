Regulatory and antitrust issues are also an issue.,22.40 USD,44.80 USD,"The release of Windows 7 should entice many enterprises and customers who skipped Windows Vista to finally upgrade from Windows XP. With a warchest of cash and an AAA debt rating, Microsoft is one of the few firms with the technical and financial resources to invest heavily in cloud computing. The Bing search engine is Microsoft's most viable effort in Internet search thus far, and its partnership with Yahoo gives both companies their best chance to chip away at Google's dominance.","Cloud computing is a disruptive force, and Microsoft may be handicapped from competing fully by the need to protect its legacy businesses.

Microsoft Corporation,32.00 USD,The Windows and Office franchises are in the early stages of a long decline,22.40 USD,44.80 USD,"Office 2010 product cycle is now in full swing, with Windows and Office segment revenue increasing by 44% and 15%, respectively. We expect both segments will continue to perform well, as the PC refresh cycle continues to roll through the enterprise market. The server and tools segment, which had stalled out for the past two years, bounced back nicely with 14% growth. One theme that has emerged this earnings season is the strength of data center-related spending. The server and tools results are another collaborating data point.","The online service division posted an operating loss of $696 million, bringing its full-year loss to $2.4 billion. Bing continues to gain incremental search share, but we expect it to remain a distant second to Google. The entertainment and devices division also post a $172 million operating loss due to charges resulting from the KIN debacle.",We expect Microsoft's fortunes to closely track those of the PC market,

The vast majority of Microsoft's revenue will come from Azure, which we believe will be a very profitable business.","The primary risk, both to the downside and upside, to our valuation revolves around our assumptions for Windows Azure. Our bear case assumes that not only do Windows, Office, and server software go into slow decline, but that Azure fails to become a dominant platform. In this case, our fair value estimate is $25.",,

With a warchest of cash and an AAA debt rating, Microsoft is one of the few firms with the technical and financial resources to invest heavily in cloud computing.

The growth of netbooks and emerging markets will pressure the selling prices of Windows. Piracy is also a larger problem in emerging markets. Although Microsoft has settled a majority of its antitrust issues, the firm will continue to operate under a regulatory microscope.
