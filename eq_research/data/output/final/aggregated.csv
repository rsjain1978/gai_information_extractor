The threat to Microsoft's core businesses of Windows and Office posed by cloud computing is the dominant risk. Regulatory and antitrust issues are also an issue.
There have been some significant executive departures in recent months that raise uncertainty about Microsoft's strategic direction
The Windows and Office franchises are in the early stages of a long decline
Our valuation revolves around our assumptions for Windows Azure. Our base case assumes that Azure grows to be a $52 billion business by 2019, while the Windows, Office, and server software businesses will have all but vanished.

12.00 USD",44.80 USD,"Microsoft reported 13% year-over-year growth to $16.2 billion of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as the company's three main businesses performed very well.
The release of Windows 7 should entice many enterprises and customers who skipped Windows Vista to finally upgrade from Windows XP. With a warchest of cash and an AAA debt rating, Microsoft is one of the few firms with the technical and financial resources to invest heavily in cloud computing. The Bing search engine is Microsoft's most viable effort in Internet search thus far, and its partnership with Yahoo gives both companies their best chance to chip away at Google's dominance.
Strong Start to 2011 for Microsoft
Office 2010 product cycle is now in full swing, with Windows and Office segment revenue increasing by 44% and 15%, respectively. We expect both segments will continue to perform well, as the PC refresh cycle continues to roll through the enterprise market. The server and tools segment, which had stalled out for the past two years, bounced back nicely with 14% growth. One theme that has emerged this earnings season is the strength of data center-related spending. The server and tools results are another collaborating data point.
Microsoft develops the Windows operating system and the Office suite of productivity software. Windows and Office account for roughly 56% of Microsoft's revenue, with another 24% coming from software for enterprise servers. The firm's other businesses include the Xbox 360 video game console, Bing Internet search, business software, and software for mobile devices.

Microsoft's competitive position is very defensible, due to powerful network effects
Our fair value estimate for Microsoft is $32 per share. We expect compound annual revenue growth of 1.9% over the next decade. The vast majority of Microsoft's revenue will come from Azure, which we believe will be a very profitable business.
The release of Windows 7 should entice many enterprises and customers who skipped Windows Vista to finally upgrade from Windows XP. With a warchest of cash and an AAA debt rating, Microsoft is one of the few firms with the technical and financial resources to invest heavily in cloud computing. Windows Azure enjoys many inherited advantages such as Microsoft's existing base of third-party Windows developers. The Bing search engine is Microsoft's most viable effort in Internet search thus far, and its partnership with Yahoo gives both companies their best chance to chip away at Google's dominance.
Microsoft's balance sheet is pristine. As of March 31, 2010, the company held $40 billion of cash. Microsoft recently took advantage of the low-cost funding environment to issue $3.75 billion of long-term debt at a 2.3% aftertax cost. Given Microsoft's low cost of debt and prodigious cash flow, we believe a greater mix of debt in the capital structure is more appropriate. The company has repurchased massive amounts of stock in recent years, and diluted shares outstanding have decreased by 17.5% during the last five years.
Management has done a superb job of transitioning Microsoft from a hypergrowth company to a mature technology giant. Although returns have declined in recent years as the firm has entered new markets outside Windows and Office, Microsoft still earned a very respectable 53% ROIC in fiscal 2009. Management also takes corporate governance seriously. Gates and Ballmer own about 10% and 4% of Microsoft, respectively, and neither has taken any stock options in the past decade. We think this level of ownership clearly aligns management's interests with those of outside shareholders. Executive compensation is below that of other large technology firms. In addition, the replacement of employee stock options with restricted-stock grants earns Microsoft an excellent Stewardship Grade.
Microsoft can leverage its greatest advantage in the smartphone race: an army of third-party developers that is already accustomed to building applications in the Microsoft development environment","Cloud computing is a singular threat to Microsoft because it allows users to access their information and applications from a multitude of hardware and software platforms. This strikes directly at the Windows platform, which is the foundation of Microsoft's moat.
Cloud computing is a disruptive force, and Microsoft may be handicapped from competing fully by the need to protect its legacy businesses. The growth of netbooks and emerging markets will pressure the selling prices of Windows. Piracy is also a larger problem in emerging markets.
The company has missed on very large opportunities such as search and mobile
The online service division posted an operating loss of $696 million, bringing its full-year loss to $2.4 billion. Bing continues to gain incremental search share, but we expect it to remain a distant second to Google. The entertainment and devices division also post a $172 million operating loss due to charges resulting from the KIN debacle.
Intense competition looms from other technology firms, which could temper returns and growth prospects.
Cloud computing is a threat to Windows and Office. We expect both businesses to decline during the next decade as users migrate to Web-based applications.
The disruptive change brought about by cloud computing will challenge Microsoft's core Windows and Office franchises
Our bear case assumes that not only do Windows, Office, and server software go into slow decline, but that Azure fails to become a dominant platform. In this case, our fair value estimate is $25.
Cloud computing is a disruptive force, and Microsoft may be handicapped from competing fully by the need to protect its legacy businesses. The growth of netbooks and emerging markets will pressure the selling prices of Windows. Piracy is also a larger problem in emerging markets. Although Microsoft has settled a majority of its antitrust issues, the firm will continue to operate under a regulatory microscope. Such regulatory oversight may make it difficult for Microsoft to raise prices or further its market share dominance.
The threat to Microsoft's core businesses of Windows and Office posed by cloud computing is the dominant risk. Google is a capable competitor that is intent on disrupting Microsoft's cash cows to restrict Microsoft's ability to disrupt Google's cash cow in Internet search. Regulatory and antitrust issues are also an issue.
Microsoft has a long climb ahead to effectively market and sell the devices to consumers"
Microsoft Corp.,,,,,,
General Motors Co,"44 USD
$44 per share","Although the ""Government Motors"" stigma is likely to hang over General Motors Company for years, we think GM's car models have their best quality and design in decades. The company is already a leader in truck models, so a fully competitive lineup, combined with a much smaller cost base, leads us to think that GM will be printing money as vehicle demand recovers.
Our fair value uncertainty is high, to account for the wide possibilities in GM's fair value, given its high degree of operating leverage.
The cadence of a recovery in global vehicle demand is very uncertain.
High",,,"We think GM's earnings potential is excellent because the firm finally has a healthy North American unit, and can focus its U.S. marketing efforts on four brands instead of eight. The most critical cost-saving measure was setting up a voluntary employees' beneficiary association for the retiree health-care costs of the United Auto Workers. This move saves GM about $3 billion a year, and other wage and benefit concessions have drastically lowered GM's North American break-even point to about 10.5 million to 11 million vehicles. The actual point varies based on mix and incentive levels. We think normative demand for U.S. light vehicles is about 16 million to 17 million units, so we expect GM to report excellent earnings growth as vehicle demand comes back over the next few years. Dramatically better pricing has helped GM be profitable at volume levels that would have meant billions in losses a few years ago. The new Buick LaCrosse, for example, sells for about $7,800 more per unit compared with 2009. Simply put, GM makes products that consumers are willing to pay more for than they once did. GM no longer has to overproduce to attempt to cover high labor costs, and then dump cars into rental fleets (which hurts residual values). It now operates in a demand-pull model, where it can produce only to meet demand, and is structured to break even at the bottom of an economic cycle. We think the largest threat to profitability is Europe, which has been losing money for a long time. The S-1 gives planned GM Europe capacity reduction and annual labor cost reduction targets of 20% and $323 million, respectively.
GM's break-even point is drastically lower than it was under old GM. The company's earnings should grow rapidly as vehicle sales rebound from 2009 levels. The VEBA saves GM billions of dollars in cash every year. New models such as the Buick LaCrosse have been very successful. GM can charge thousands of dollars more per vehicle than it used to in certain vehicle segments. Higher prices allow GM to achieve greater margin per vehicle, which helps mitigate the severe decline in light-vehicle sales.
GM already is a top player in critical emerging markets such as Brazil and China. It sells about 70% of its vehicles outside North America.
We like having new leadership, since it removes any element of the arrogance and resistance to change that hindered the old regime, in our opinion.","GM stockholders have to consider politics as long as the U.S. Treasury, Canadian and Ontario governments, and an affiliate of the UAW own large amounts of GM stock. We think this ownership will be an overhang on the stock for some time, since the U.S. government is likely to sell off its stake gradually in order to get the highest possible share price to get its money back. We also expect the VEBA to reduce its stake over time, since it needs to monetize its holdings to pay retiree health-care claims. Although these concerns are valid, we see them as short-term issues. We think the company is about to see the upside to having a high degree of operating leverage.
The biggest risk to GM would be a scenario where too many Americans refuse to buy its vehicles because of animosity over the taxpayer-financed bailout, and the government's continued ownership of the company. If sales were to decline for many years, GM would probably go bankrupt. Another risk comes from GM disclosing it has a material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting. This issue has been a problem for several years now. Although we think that GM is close to correcting the deficiency, poor internal controls raise the inherent risk for problems, such as a material restatement of results due to error or fraud. Another important risk is GM's underfunded pension. The plan was underfunded by $26.4 billion as of June 30. Management does not expect to be forced to make a material contribution until 2014, but that assertion is only an estimate. On Oct. 28, GM announced that, after the IPO, it will contribute $4 billion in cash to the pension, and another $2 billion in GM stock.
Some American consumers will never buy another GM vehicle because of their anger over GM receiving taxpayer loans.
We have to give GM a low grade because of the significant influence exerted by the VEBA and U.S. Treasury, and for not separating the CEO and chairman roles."

Overall executive cash compensation looks reasonable, with no senior officer making a salary above $300,000 and a 2009 executive bonus pool of $1.4 million.
