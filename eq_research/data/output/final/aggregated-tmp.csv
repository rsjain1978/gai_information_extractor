Microsoft Corporation,32.00 USD,"There have been some significant executive departures in recent months that raise uncertainty about Microsoft's strategic direction
The threat to Microsoft's core businesses of Windows and Office posed by cloud computing is the dominant risk. Regulatory and antitrust issues are also an issue.
The Windows and Office franchises are in the early stages of a long decline
Medium",22.40 USD,44.80 USD,"Microsoft reported 13% year-over-year growth to $16.2 billion of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as the company's three main businesses performed very well
The release of Windows 7 should entice many enterprises and customers who skipped Windows Vista to finally upgrade from Windows XP. With a warchest of cash and an AAA debt rating, Microsoft is one of the few firms with the technical and financial resources to invest heavily in cloud computing. The Bing search engine is Microsoft's most viable effort in Internet search thus far, and its partnership with Yahoo gives both companies their best chance to chip away at Google's dominance.
Strong Start to 2011 for Microsoft
Office 2010 product cycle is now in full swing, with Windows and Office segment revenue increasing by 44% and 15%, respectively. We expect both segments will continue to perform well, as the PC refresh cycle continues to roll through the enterprise market. The server and tools segment, which had stalled out for the past two years, bounced back nicely with 14% growth. One theme that has emerged this earnings season is the strength of data center-related spending. The server and tools results are another collaborating data point.
Our fair value estimate for Microsoft is $32 per share. We expect compound annual revenue growth of 1.9% over the next decade. The vast majority of Microsoft's revenue will come from Azure, which we believe will be a very profitable business.
The release of Windows 7 should entice many enterprises and customers who skipped Windows Vista to finally upgrade from Windows XP. With a warchest of cash and an AAA debt rating, Microsoft is one of the few firms with the technical and financial resources to invest heavily in cloud computing. Windows Azure enjoys many inherited advantages such as Microsoft's existing base of third-party Windows developers.

Expect earnings to grow considerably","The disruptive change brought about by cloud computing will challenge Microsoft's core Windows and Office franchises
Cloud computing is a disruptive force, and Microsoft may be handicapped from competing fully by the need to protect its legacy businesses. The growth of netbooks and emerging markets will pressure the selling prices of Windows. Piracy is also a larger problem in emerging markets.
The company has missed on very large opportunities such as search and mobile
The online service division posted an operating loss of $696 million, bringing its full-year loss to $2.4 billion. Bing continues to gain incremental search share, but we expect it to remain a distant second to Google. The entertainment and devices division also post a $172 million operating loss due to charges resulting from the KIN debacle.
The primary risk, both to the downside and upside, to our valuation revolves around our assumptions for Windows Azure. Our bear case assumes that not only do Windows, Office, and server software go into slow decline, but that Azure fails to become a dominant platform. In this case, our fair value estimate is $25.
Cloud computing is a disruptive force, and Microsoft may be handicapped from competing fully by the need to protect its legacy businesses. The growth of netbooks and emerging markets will pressure the selling prices of Windows. Piracy is also a larger problem in emerging markets. Although Microsoft has settled a majority of its antitrust issues, the firm will continue to operate under a regulatory microscope. Such regulatory oversight may make it difficult for Microsoft to raise prices or further its market share dominance.","Software - Infrastructure

General Motors Co,44 USD,"Although the ""Government Motors"" stigma is likely to hang over General Motors Company for years
Our fair value uncertainty is high, to account for the wide possibilities in GM's fair value, given its high degree of operating leverage.
High",,,"We think GM's earnings potential is excellent because the firm finally has a healthy North American unit, and can focus its U.S. marketing efforts on four brands instead of eight
GM's break-even point is drastically lower than it was under old GM. The company's earnings should grow rapidly as vehicle sales rebound from 2009 levels.
GM already is a top player in critical emerging markets such as Brazil and China. It sells about 70% of its vehicles outside North America.","The largest threat to profitability is Europe, which has been losing money for a long time
The biggest risk to GM would be a scenario where too many Americans refuse to buy its vehicles because of animosity over the taxpayer-financed bailout, and the government's continued ownership of the company.
The cadence of a recovery in global vehicle demand is very uncertain. The collective bargaining agreement with the UAW expires in September 2011. Although the UAW has agreed not to strike, it is still looking to get back some of what it gave up during the bankruptcy. Some American consumers will never buy another GM vehicle because of their anger over GM receiving taxpayer loans.","As global light-vehicle demand recovers
