We have also begun the rollout of our climate rating, introduced in 2021 as part of Fidelity’s Climate Investing Policy, which identifies the companies we should engage with first and most as part of our aim to halve portfolio emissions by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. We are pushing hard for integrated risk assessments and enhanced traceability of supply chains, while also addressing related issues such as decent working conditions for vulnerable groups of workers. We are developing more strategies aligned to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ramping up engagement in three key sustainable investing areas: ending deforestation, ensuring a just transition and, crucially, the principle of double materiality.",,,,,,,

Fidelity International,,,,,,,,,"We launched our Climate Investing Policy and to meet the ambitious goals outlined in our policy we emphasised the crucial role of climate stewardship. We expect investee issuers to have policies in place to reduce carbon and other GHG emissions. They should also be able to adhere to potential regulation on climate change, as well as have a strategy to reduce Scope 3 emissions and to make assumptions about carbon pricing.",,
Fidelity International,,,"Climate change is a key and increasing focus of our corporate engagements. In 2021, our fundamental and sustainable investing analysts engaged extensively with companies to improve the ambition of climate change strategies and quality of disclosures in over five hundred engagements. In these interactions, we promote decarbonisation strategies aligned with the Paris Agreement goals and disclosures of GHG emissions data across all scopes. We also advocate for TCFD-aligned reporting that clearly defines oversight and responsibilities for climate strategy, and assessments of climate-related financial risks and opportunities. Beyond direct dialogues, we believe industry collaboration is imperative to support our ambition of a low-carbon transition. Our involvement with the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Climate Action 100+ initiatives is a critical aspect of our collaborative engagement on climate, and examples of this are detailed in two case studies below. Our engagement also extends to policymakers, where we regularly contribute to public consultations on financing the transition to net zero and the role that asset managers can play.","Committed to phase-out thermal coal from our portfolios by 2030 in OECD markets and by 2040 globally, via intensive and time-bound transition engagements",,,,,,,

Fidelity International,,,"Fidelity plays a key role in several long-running initiatives that focus on human rights and modern slavery, an example of one such collaborative engagement with Investors Against Slavery and Trafficking, APAC (IAST) is detailed later in this section. We also encourage companies to examine the risks of modern slavery and the broader risks of labour exploitation, as this is a leading indicator of modern slavery, by running a risk-based mapping exercise of their supply chain that could help companies to achieve better visibility of the supply chain across sectors and geographies and identify the more at-risk suppliers to prioritise their focus. Fidelity also engages with a range of companies on other social issues that we broadly define as affecting either customers or communities. Examples range from responsible marketing or product/service quality (customer-related impacts) to broadened access for basic goods/services (community-related impacts). During 2021, a notable focus in this domain was access to medicine.","We expect issuers to practice fair treatment of workers, including contractors and sub-contractors, and we look for decent wages, collective bargaining policies, freedom of association and grievance mechanisms. These expectations also apply to issuers’ supply chains, to the extent that they should take responsibility, and be able to account for both the human and materials sourcing side of their supply chains. Issuers should have measures in place to ensure suppliers meet a code of conduct, applicable to tier 1 and 2 (at the minimum with a plan to apply it to beyond tier 2) suppliers, with robust policies and training in place to help find and mitigate against instances of modern slavery.",,,,,,,

Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Limited,,,40:40 Vision initiative on gender diversity,,,"The company has not historically had company-wide targets or gender quotas, but it does have board level targets. The leadership team was all male, although the company did have one female joining in February 2021. The company informed us that it has committed to setting the 40:40:20 targets. The company is also looking to address gender diversity at the company level, ensuring they there is 50:50 representation during the recruitment process. It is also looking at peer practices to understand and establish best practice. The company faces some structural headwinds; much of the senior management team come from franchisees, where most of the employees are drivers, who are predominantly male. To address this, the company has set up internal groups to review the current talent pool of women in the franchises and has recently elected the first female to their Franchise Advisory Council.",,,,,

Fidelity International,,,,,,,,,"We expect companies to have a robust corporate governance framework that can define long-term, innovative strategies and implement them for the benefit of all stakeholders. Vision and effective oversight are key to building a company with sustainable long-term success. Effective boards play a critical role in the strategic direction of an issuer, and overseeing risk management processes. We expect the majority of board members to be independent with the suitable skills to fulfil supervisory duties as well as provide guidance and constructive challenges to executive management. We expect boards to reflect or demonstrate a plan for improving gender, ethnic and cognitive diversity. Issuers should promote an ethical culture and code of conduct that permeates throughout the organisation. Corrupt business practices represent a significant investment risk and create negative externalities for the broader economy and society. The board should ensure that the issuer fosters a culture of acting lawfully, ethically and responsibly. To this end, the board should ensure that the issuer has adequate whistle blower, anti-bribery and corruption policies in place and is actively monitoring the application of those policies. In 2021, we set out expectations for the number of boards directors should serve on and encouraged companies to be mindful about director refreshment. We also asked companies to consider periodic refreshment of their auditor as a matter of best practice and, particularly in the US where audit tenures can be decades long, we have been engaging and starting to vote against companies that have not made the requisite changes.",,
